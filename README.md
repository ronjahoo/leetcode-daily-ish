# 🧩 LeetCode Daily – My Solutions

A repository for my **daily practice** using [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and python.  
I aim to solve one problem per day, and keep a clean log.

⚠️ Disclaimer: Only my solutions and notes are included. The problem statements belong to LeetCode.

## 📂 Structure
- Each folder `xxx-ddmmyy_problem-name/` contains:
  - `solution.py` – my implementation
  - `notes.md` – reflections (complexity, edge cases, what I learned)
  - `tests.py` – optional unit tests
